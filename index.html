				<h2>Predictive Modeling for Soil Health and Agricultural Insights in Fresno County</h2>
				<p>This project aimed to assess soil health and predict critical parameters for agriculture. Data was collected from remote sensing satellites, ground sensors, surveys, radars, and weather systems, covering soil temperature, moisture, pH, carbon, and nitrogen, alongside weather variables like temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Additional data on soil types, crops, and farmland across Fresno County zip codes spanned January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2022.
<br><br>After merging and preprocessing the datasets, outliers were mitigated using logarithmic transformations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights through correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, histograms, and time-series graphs. Trends and relationships among variables were analyzed across seasons and years.
<br><br>Eight machine learning models‚ÄîARIMA, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, LSTM, and a hybrid LSTM+Random Forest model‚Äîwere employed to predict soil parameters. The data was split 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation. Results showed that soil temperature and moisture were strongly influenced by weather, while carbon, nitrogen, and pH remained stable in the short term but exhibited long-term changes. Carbon and nitrogen declined over time, and pH showed increased acidity, likely due to farming practices.
<br><br>An interactive GUI visualized the findings, allowing users to explore geospatial maps with weather, soil, and crop data by clicking location pins. Time-series graphs showed trends for predicted parameters, pie charts depicted crop and soil type distributions, and tabular data presented daily predictions filterable by zip code or date.
					<br>
				<br>
				Real-Time Usage: This project offers actionable insights into soil health and long-term trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions for sustainable agriculture.</p>

				<h2>Data Mining Workforce Dynamics: Understanding Employee Attrition</h2>
				<p>The Employee Attrition Prediction project leverages advanced machine learning models, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to predict employee turnover using the IBM HR Analytics Dataset. The project emphasizes meticulous preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to pinpoint key factors influencing attrition. Feature selection and binary classification techniques are employed to train the models accurately.
				The project prioritizes recall as the primary metric, fixing precision to optimize cost-effectiveness in retention strategies. The XGBoost model achieved a superior recall of 77%, effectively identifying employees at risk of leaving. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models also performed well, each attaining a recall of 70%. A detailed business case study reveals that losing an employee costs approximately $50,000, while effective retention strategies cost about $15,000 per employee. By setting the precision threshold at 30%, the model ensures a cost-effective approach to retention, balancing the expenses associated with turnover reduction. This project illustrates the potential of machine learning in predicting employee attrition, offering valuable data-driven insights to enhance workforce stability and organizational performance. By identifying at-risk employees early, organizations can implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing turnover costs and fostering a more stable workforce.</p>

				<h2>Online Recruitment Fraud: Fake Job Classification using Machine Learning</h2>
				<p>This binary classification project aims to identify fraudulent job postings using the publicly available EMSCAD dataset, contributing to the fight against job scams. By leveraging this dataset, the research community gains valuable data to develop effective solutions for detecting fraudulent job listings. To tackle this issue, we employed various supervised machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree, and random forest. Textual data from job postings were processed using the NLTK word cloud and TF-IDF techniques to extract meaningful features. To address the dataset's imbalance, sampling techniques were utilized to ensure balanced training data. Each model underwent rigorous hyperparameter and threshold tuning to enhance performance. The evaluation focused on several metrics, with a particular emphasis on recall, ensuring the models were adept at identifying fraudulent job postings. Among the models, the decision tree emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior ability in distinguishing genuine jobs from fraudulent ones. This project showcases the power of machine learning in combating job fraud. By accurately predicting fraudulent postings, the models can significantly reduce the risk for job seekers, enhancing trust and security in the job market. This innovative approach not only aids in safeguarding applicants but also contributes to a more reliable employment ecosystem..</p>

					<h3> MAT JOURNAL</h3>
					<p> 
The project revolves around the creation of a versatile robot aimed at rescuing a child trapped in a pipeline, innovatively developed using Raspberry Pi technology. Central to its functionality is Zigbee communication, facilitating seamless coordination during rescue operations. The incorporation of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) ensures the robot's adaptability, causing it to emit light when confronted with dark surroundings. A pivotal feature involves the utilization of a DC motor, enabling the robot to navigate both upward and downward within the pipeline, ensuring comprehensive rescue capabilities.<br><br>

Beyond its primary rescue objective, the robot exhibits adaptability through a customizable gripper design. This feature broadens its scope for various applications, showcasing its versatility beyond the initial rescue intent. The significance of this project is underscored by the publication of a research paper in MAT Journals, solidifying its contribution to the scientific community. Overall, this initiative not only addresses a critical scenario involving child rescue but also lays the foundation for a multipurpose robotic platform with potential applications across diverse domains. This research paper on "Pipeline Rescue Robot using Raspberri Pi" is published in the MAT Journals, Volume 1, Issue 1, 2022.</p>
